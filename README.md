Q: The management requested a new feature where in the fictional e-commerce app must have a "featured products" section.
How would you go about implementing this feature in the backend?

A: Since the products are featured, I would implement it in a way where
the featured products will be the very first thing that the consumer will
see on the page. At the same time make the design on the featured products
to be alluring.
